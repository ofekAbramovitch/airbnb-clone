The kitchen has everything you need with Alex and Shalia stocking it with a few basics. The neighbourhood is a little shabby, especially compared to the home we stayed in. We were told by some people in Manhattan that the neighbour of Bed-Stuy used to be very dangerous and just to be careful walking around at night. Walking from the subway after dark was a little daunting but we remained safe. We did catch a cab a few times from Manhattan as it was very late. Overall, it was a positive experience with Alex and Shalia being very helpful, even going out of their way to let us store our luggage at Shalia's work the day we were to fly out. They were great hosts.",

We would use our vehicle to drive to the subway station (there are two corresponding)  and park nearby to facilitate the to and from.  If you need quick access to the subway at all hours of the day and night this may not be the place for you.\n\nThe apt. is an excellent value  for the money (as per  many  manhattan locations offer around  the same nightly  $$ rate but have to share their apt ).\n\n\n\n",

It was a very cozy place to come back to after long days out exploring New York. The subways are very close. We preferred heading up to broadway to catch our trains (Depending where we were going) only because it was much more pleasant on sunny days to be above grounds if we could. It was great to have all amenities available, and at such a reasonable price.The only thing I will mention is that if you do plan on sleeping in- it might not happen as they do have a newborn who you can sometimes hear in the morning if you are a light sleeper.\r\nOverall,  I would recommend you stay at Alex & Shailas airbnb! It was a great and pleasant environment.",

You have to share the appartment with Marian so pay attention and don't be too loud in the evening!!\r\ndisadvantage: the heat is terrible in summer and there is no air-condition..\r\n\r\nI would overall recommend it to everybody!!

Be it in spoken or written form I always got my answers from her within no times. She also proofed to be very flexible in terms of arrival and departure times which I appreciated a great deal. If you are a fan of jazz music (like I am), make sure to double check ahead of time about her current concert dates so as not to miss your hostess on stage like I did (grumble ;-)).\n\nThe room I occupied was the smaller one of two that Isabel rents out. So if her flat is fully rented out there can be a maximum of 4 guests plus your hostess in the flat, which can cause some bathroom jam, especially during the hot and humid summer times, when the need for a cool shower is inherent to everyone's desire. \nMy room was as depicted. If you plan on using it for double occupancy, I recommend taking Isa's larger room (unless the two of you are very much in love and want to cuddle up close ;-)). Also, if you need a table for writing, ask for the larger room as well, which comes along with one.\nThe flat itself is absolutely enchanting and furnished with love and an artistic eye to details. It's location is a dream for touristic explorations with anything within walking distance. \nTherefore, I can easily recommend both Isabel and her flat to anyone wishing to immerge himself into the local customs and get a good doze of what it is like \"to live like a true Barcelonian\".  \n\nQuerida Isa, muchas gracias por tu hospedalid génial! Volveré a ciencia cierta!\nSaludos y besos\nLiliana",

It's a 20 minute walk from the beach which is a plus. It's located in a very old building on the top floor, so it is rather stuffy and warm in the apartment. The room overlooks a very narrow street/alley so it's rather dark and it's easy to hear the noise coming from the street and the neighboring apartments. There are a few other rooms in the house that are being rented out, so other people will be staying in the house which makes it a necessity to lock the room when you leave the apartment. \n\nIt's important to note that this place has a very strict check out time. On our last day, we had an evening flight but had to check out in the morning. When we asked if we could check out late, Isa told us to take our stuff to the train station and use the lockers there, but the train station does not have lockers. We ended up renting a locker  at a place called \"Barcelona lockers\". That, I would say changed all the plans for the last day. \n\n",

Isabel is a creative, sensitive and respectful person, with an open mind- yet she has the necessary boundaries that are required to organize an environment where so many different people are going to stay and hopefully enjoy. \nThe street itself is very lively, but the noises didn't bother me at all as i could easily block them out with earplugs. The location could not have been more sentral, still it's on \"the right side\" of the Rambla, where you can find more independent shops, restaurants, cafes and bars compared to the same leveled streets towards Raval. It is an old and very charming building, so if you want an minimalistic experience with cold, stainless steel and elevators this is not the place for you! And perhaps you are not the right person for this place either ;) I had to leave earlier due to illness, and was so sorry i couldn't stay throughout the whole month as planned. Hope to be seeing Isabel and her welcoming surroundings again one day ",

Nos proveyó de un matress de aire para nuestra amiga que vino de M.A. y se quedó una noche con nosotros. El barrio nos pareció bien, no tuvimos ningún incidente. Muchos puertoriqueños y Dominicanos, así que nos sentimos como en casa. Todo fue muy cómodo y limpio. Los vecinos hicieron mucho ruido en las noches, pero no fue problema para nosotros. Una sugerencia sería poner un espejo de cuerpo completo en alguna parte del apartento. En resumen, el apartamento fue perfecto para nosotros, nos volveríamos a quedar y claro que lo recomendaría!

It is just a short 5-min walk from the subway station, so very convenient. Street noise is not a problem although you can hear the neighbors at times (the kids next door can be noisy). East Harlem is a bustling Latino neighborhood with many local eateries and shops. The food selection is supposed to be great (too bad we didn't get to try any). There is a grocery store right outside the building. There're always locals hanging out in front but we were never bothered. All and all, a good choice if you are looking to stay in this part of the city.",

He was very friendly at house, and we had the chance to spend time together outside. Staying with him reflects the true meaning of this website, which is living as a local with a local person. Thank you Nihat. \nRegarding the apartment, it is exactly as described. The room is nice and bed is comfortable. It was clean and well prepared for us. \nRegarding the neighborhood, it is very close to Taksim square and Istiklal Street with few minutes walk. As normal as it is in Istanbul, there is a short hill you need to walk to get to the square, which was totally fine with us. \n\nIn general, next time I visit Istanbul I would first check the availability with Nihat before searching others.",

The condo is located in a quiet but convenient neighbourhood and close to many amenities. We found the condo extremely spacious and it accommodated our party of 3 adults and two teenaged children with no problem at all. Cynthia's condo is the penthouse and is set right on the beach so we were treated to gorgeous Hawaiian sunsets every night, as well as being able to see turtles and whales from our balcony. The condo is beautifully presented and very well equipped - we could not have asked for anything more for our nine day stay. \r\nMahalo Cynthia ",

While climbing nine flights of stairs during an unexpected elevator renovation (that ends in May!) does not sound fun, it was actually not bad at all for the adults in our party, as well as the 3 sub-8 year old children, and allowed us to think we were earning all the delicious calories we ate and drank.\n\nI cannot rave enough about the amenities that are incredibly family friendly, including a full sized high chair, travel crib, toddler (and big kid) friendly toys for both indoors and at the beach. Cynthia is very quick to respond to communication and is clear as to what she can provide as a host, as well as her expectation of guests. She was as incredible as her Kahana home was and we'd highly recommend this place for anyone, including those with small children.",

I have informed the householder at once. When we arrived at the airport, we could not find the driver waiting for us at the arrival with our name. Then, I tried to ask for the help from the householder to meet the driver at the airport. After almost one-hour waiting, we are refused by the driver to meet at the airport and He asked us to find his car at the park. How ridiculous! This service costs 20 euro each person but we cannot even have the right to be picked up. We were so angry and chose to take the taxi. At the same time, I texted the householder that we were tired of waiting for the driver and we were on the way to ur apartment by taxi.\n\nThe householder didn't tell me that I should phone another guy to tell him that we were on the way to the apartment until We arrived. What all she talked about were the money of the pick-up service. We spent another 45 minutes to wait for the guy to send the key. Again, when he came, he talked about the money. We asked for the service, but u did not provide it with us. How dare u to ask for the payment? Besides, do u know what? We are totally seven people, so this service should cost 140 euro totally. But two taxis only cost us 70 euro. The driver knows the guy and the householder. I doubt that they are on the business to play trick with me.\n\nBarcelona is a really nice city to travel, but this experience does make a bad impression on me. \n ",

L'unico problemino c'è stato con la porta del bagno che è stato facile chiudere, ma non più riaprire, ma c'è stato subito un pronto intervento da parte dei responsabili dell'appartamento, che hanno aiutato ad uscire la persona che era rimasta chiusa all'interno. Salvo questo però Il quartiere era tranquillo , c'erano vari baretti attorno e anche dei piccoli centri commerciali ( di tipo alimentare ). Era in oltre possibile raggiungere a piedi vari bar dove potersi divertire. I taxi per arrivare nel centro della movida variano con i prezzi dai 5 ai 7 euro a corsa. La fermata della metro era a 5 min a piedi dall'appartamento. Dal centro partiva una navetta che portava direttamente all'aeroporto per soli 4 euro e 90. ",

Regina had organised someone to meet us on arrival so check in was easy. Check out was easy  llew as we just had to leave the flat at the agreed time. I would only say that the check out time of 11am is a bit early, especially for a city when you can have dinner quite late... although upon our request, Regina allowed us nicely to stay until 12pm.\r\nThey were two sets of keys which was very convenient for a big group. \r\nI have suggested to regina that it would be great to have a few more amenities provided such as toilet paper and coffee/tea for example, but overall we were very pleased with our stay at Regina's place. Thank you Regina!\r\n\r\n",

We stayed here for 3 nights with our two children and found it perfect. We were able to walk or take the metro everywhere we wanted to go, but have a quieter place to sleep and relax. There is a park down the street and a supermarket directly across. Xavi met us on arrival and was very nice and helpful throughout our stay. When my husband accidentally left a few things in the apartment, Xavi collected them and met us upon our return to Barcelona a few days later to return them. Thanks, Xavi! It was a great stay in Barcelona and I would definitely recommend the apartment to anyone looking for space and comfort in a close but quieter neighborhood. ",

The duplex was very nice and spacious, clean, charming, outfitted with everything we needed, with comfortable beds and a very nice kitchen (with an induction cooktop!).  The property is older and there was some remodeling noise for a few hours from the neighboring apartment, which we could hear through what seemed to be a shared skylight, but it was very brief and not a concern (unless noise privacy is a very high priority, which it wasn't for us).  We didn't even use the third bedroom with bunk beds, but it would be ideal for a family.  The metro was close enough, and the bakery just downstairs, together with the grocery store literally across the street, were a wonderful convenience.  We went nearly everywhere by metro, and the location was central enough that at the end of the day, if we were too tired to make our way back by metro, an easy cab ride back to the apartment never exceeded 8 euros (which would've been the cost of the metro for all four of us anyway).  Overall, the apartment was a nice, comfortable bargain for family travel - not the most modern, but charming and fully met our needs.",

Before the trip, we were given immediate and friendly response from host and on the day of our arrival, she came to pick us up at the nearest bus stop, where we took a direct cityflyer bus from the Airport as per our host's guidance.\r\n\r\nApt was tidy, clean, cosy and comfortable for our three nights stay. Host even provided snacks/tidbits and several drink mix. There were bedroom slippers, electric kettle, microwave, cups, bowls and utensils, TV, basic toiletries and hairdryer. We were told that the temperature of the aircon could not be adjusted but that did not affect us at all because the temperature was just right throughout our stay during the rainy season period. \r\n\r\nWe were also given a precise mini tour of what was in the apt and how we could use the very convenient sofa bed (which we didn't use in the end because the third person did not stay with us). There's wifi in the apt as well. However, we did experience some connection issues with the TV on one night which we gave up after awhile when we couldn't watch the few channels we wanted to. \r\n\r\nIt's a very quiet building located extremely convenient to the MTR, just 2 minutes walk to the nearest exit (and probably another 5-8 mins walk before you reach the MTR gantry). Right across the building on the ground floor there are two popular cafes and one ice cream shop that I would highly recommend and they need no introduction, just (Hidden by Airbnb) it if you're a fellow cafehopper/dessert person. \r\n\r\nIt is also very near the k11 mall, an art mall that I loved a lot and even managed to check out the Urban Sense art exhibition for free! (Because we snapped a photo of the exhibition board and posted it on our social media accounts but thankfully we went in for free as there were nothing much in there and we were basically out in 15 minutes. But still, do check it out if you happen to be there and follow the instructions to get the free entrance!)\r\n\r\nAt the end of our stay, our host even surprised with a little gift - a box of Jenny Bakery cookies, which we really appreciated a lot :)\r\n\r\nOverall, it's a nice, cosy little apt for 2-3 pax accommodation in Hong Kong and definitely cheaper but value-for-money alternative compared to hotel stay. It was smaller than I had imagined since I have only stayed in hotel during all my trips to HK located on the Hong Kong island but truth be told, I wouldn't mind heading back to book my stay with Michelle&May, probably check out their other listings which are all also located on Kowloon :)",

Easy walk down to grass field and beach access right there.  Perfect for how many guest we had (5-6). Price was fair especially for the holiday week rates.  Left some extra body boards for future guests to enjoy.  Thank you Kathy for sharing your home.  Aloha ",

All bedrooms had windows that would open and most of time there was a strong breeze blowing through the entire condo. The general location, central Maui, was perfect as well.

It was spotless and had everything we needed for our stay.  The kitchen had all of the utensils and dishes necessary to prepare meals in if wanted.  The appliances were all new and the apartment in general was in great condition.  There are 4 separate bedrooms each with a desk, closet and drawers.  The apartment is in a great neighborhood with easy access to anything you want to do.  We LOVED the area and I enjoyed running in the nearby park daily.  The neighborhood is very safe and we all felt immediately \"at home.\" I cannot say enough about the customer service provided by Flatbook.  Upon check we had an issue with the lockbox.  Erika was over within 5 minutes to assist us.  She was kind, personable and professional.  We had a small issue with one the beds that had not been properly assembled.  We sent a message and within hours someone came and delivered a new bed. There was a minor issue with front door of the building as it appeared someone had broken a hinge. This didn't really compromise security but I let them know as I thought it would polite.  It was fixed before I saw it again.  I have stayed at hotels with maintenance teams on site that could not provide this level of customer service.  They truly deliver on their promise of 5 star 24 hour service.  I would be thrilled to have future booking accompanied with Flatbook service and can't wait to use them again!!!!",

Il sofa bed è praticamente un divano sporco dove abbiamo dovuto chiedere lenzuola e ci è stato dato un solo lenzuolo. Il bagno è una latrina minuscola tanto è vero che non appare nelle foto pubblicate. Non abbiamo potuto dormire neanche una notte perché non c'è neanche un cassetto o un armadio vuoto in cui poter stipare i propri effetti. Abbiamo pagato per tre notti oltre 800 euro, non abbiamo passato neanche venti minuti in quella casa, abbiamo dovuto trovare all'1 di notte un'altra sistemazione a New YorK - per cinque persone, compresi due bambini minori - e Chelsea non ci ha risarcito neanche un euro.

There is also a lovely river walk about 15 minutes away which give you the most wonderful views of Manhattan, and there are loungers to relax on at the waters edge!\r\nThe house is absolutely beautiful (you can tell Orestes is an architect), you have your own front door and the room is plenty big enough (I stayed with a friend - she slept on the double futon which was very comfy). It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.\r\nAs a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we'd wanted. He also had a lovely little dog called Kiki!\r\nThere was no weird faff with deposits or cleaning fees, everything was simple and wonderful. I honestly can't wait to go back and I want to take all of my friends. Don't hesitate to stay here.\r\nThanks Orestes, it was fabulous x",

Most of the evenings the cigarette smoke was unavoidable, though not too bad if you kept the door to the guest room shut.

It was great to be able to withdraw to the Queens peace and quiet after a long day in Manhattan - and only one subway stop away. Orestes house is located in a historically beautiful street and the room is comfortably furnished with a touch of creative people. Nice bathroom with a shower big enough for two and the sunny garden was beautiful.\r\n\r\nIt was nice to meet Orestes and Cristiàns hospitality, helpfulness and kindness and Kikki, the dog of the house, always greeted us welcome. We felt very welcome and our expectations were fully met. We will certainly return to this place again when we visit New York next time and can only give our warmest recommendations to this place.\r\n",

L'appartement est très bien situé, à deux pas du métro! Les escaliers de la résidence étaient bien étroits, et il y à 5 étages à monter! Mais nous étions prévenu, c'est écrit sur l'annonce, ça nous a permis de bien digérer le repas avant de dormir!

Удачное расположение квартиры позволяет экономить на проезде, до площади Испании и фонтана Монжуик десять минут, до площади Каталонии чуть подальше. Рядом много кафе и магазинов. Из-за рабочего графика Монс, мы видели ее очень редко, поэтому фактически вся квартира была в нашем распоряжении. Это был наш первый опыт с airbnb и он оказался удачным.",

The sink drained realy slowly so was a little discouraging.  Shower was fine, water pressure a little low.  2) our room, the Green Room, is right on St. Denis - trucks ROARing woke us early a.m.  3) be sure to take your room key with you when you go to the bathroom, etc, otherwise your door will lock!  Maybe I'm fussier than my younger reviewers, but these are important to note.  Otherwise, a very nice stay with friendly and knowledgable hosts.\r\n",

The facilities were fantastic and we enjoyed using the pool (which is also a lot bigger in person) which has stunning views over Rio, including Christ the Redeemer on Corcovado mountain. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and learnt our faces immediately so we had no problem at all gaining access to the very secure apartment (the staff buzz you in the gates via CCTV). The neighbourhood is more downtown Rio and if you like a good night out it will be perfect for you. We didn't feel that the neighbourhood was the safest of areas in Rio, but then again anywhere in Rio during the night isn't the safest place to be. The noise from the street at night was sometimes a little loud especially on Fridays and Saturdays which are extremely busy times in Lapa however we understand that this noise is unavoidable and inevitable. It must also be taken into consideration that we were in Rio for the busiest two weeks of the year, during the 2016 Olympics, a time when at night there were hundreds of thousands of tourists on the streets as well as the locals! Despite this as soon as we entered the double electronic gated apartment block we felt completely at ease and safe and during or time in Rio we spent one of the day's exploring Lapa, admiring its arches and the colourful artwork and graffiti that the locality had to offer. The apartment was perfect for us, size, location, accessibility were all excellent. Our neighbours were very friendly and helpful and would always say \"good morning\" and \"good evening\" in the elevator throughout the day. There was a very convenient supermarket just 1 minutes  walk from the apartment and the kitchen had everything you could possible need. If however you prefer to eat out, Lapa has many excellent bars and restaurants and so does Copacabana and Ipanena if you want to travel a little further away. The shower was particularly excellent-hot water was always in abundance. This apartment had everything we wanted and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay during our time spent in Rio De Janeiro for the Olympics. If and when we ever return to Rio Dejanira's apartment is the only option for us and we would love to stay there again.",

Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn't and they didn't, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren't. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are \"doctored up\" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it's definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal. Case in point - I showed my 11 year old the pictures of the listed before we took our trip and upon arrival his first words were \"this looks nothing like the photos.\" **that being said, our boys LOVED waking up in the morning when the tide was out and going exploring in the exposed reefs for fish and sea creatures - this is the most redeeming quality of this unit. We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you're paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned. I texted the owner several...",

Do not believe the other guest review... nothing was doctored up, the furniture was great, we used the AC whenever we wanted to.  There were plenty of sand toys, snorkel gear, etc.  There were no issues.  \n\nMy sister and I were on a quest to see as many turtles on Maui as possible and we saw more than 5 everyday right in front of the condo!  They come and feed on the reef between the hours of 10 am and 3 pm.  Much better than having to drag all of your stuff to the beach and then back.  My husband would be sitting outside on the patio enjoying his coffee and cigar, signal that there was a turtle, and we literally threw on our bathing suits, grabbed the snorkel gear and were in the water in a matter of seconds!  \n\nA total of 4 adults stayed at the condo for over a week and it was cozy but very comfortable.  The kitchen had everything that we needed.  We cooked breakfast, cut fruit from the farmers market, made smoothies; every kitchen tool we needed was there for us.  The beds were comfortable, there were curtains that we could shut to let some breeze in but still have privacy.  The newly done wood-like tile floors were a plus also.  \n\nWe had looked at many condos in this area and in the Kihei area and we are so glad we chose this one.  Francesco was also so easy to work with, always responded quickly when we had questions.  Could not have asked for a better host.",

There are 2 bedrooms, 1 with 2 single beds and 1 with a queen size bed and a pull out couch in the living room. The 2 single beds and the pull out couch were in bad shape. Both of the single beds were completely sloped (over used perhaps) and the pull out bed was completely sunken-in, and very very uncomfortable. Aside from the beds, the location and resort was great. The pool was nice and quiet, there is a great view facing the water by the kitchen and it was decently clean. A few notes for potential guests - we did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and some dirty qtips on the floor in one of the bedrooms, but we did a few vacuum and sweeps on our own over the week. Also an FYI - there was also not enough toilet paper for the week, so you'll have to get your own. Anyway, over all, a really great place - great location and a nice quiet spot in Maui. :)",

The home is equipped with everything needed for beach/fun (snorkels, massive amounts of towels, play equipment, boogie boards, inflatables, even a couple pairs of water shoes) Unfortunately, because of construction and large waves forming sinkholes, there was a very obstructed view of the ocean due to a temporary fence/cones, plus construction workers walking back & forth across the patio area. This meant the patio area was not as private and not as usable due to the fencing.  Francesco was accommodating in partially refunding us and has been very quick to respond to any issues we had.\n\nNote as other reviewers have said, this property is shorefront/oceanfront not beachfront, which means if you stay during a time when there are large waves, you won’t be able to walk out of the patio area and jump in the ocean since there are lots of large rocks lining the shorefront and very little sand/beach space. There’s a beach only 1 block away perfect for kids since it has a natural wading pool with rocks blocking the waves.  This however is not good for swimming and adults will need water shoes to get over the rock barrier.",

Be aware that the access to the waterfront/beach is closed due to construction. \n\nWe had some issues with the cleanness of the house and ended up buying wet Swiffer ourselves and clean the floor and some other kitchen amenities that wasn't fully clean when we arrived. \n\nHot shower was also not working for multiple times, and there are several occasions (at least we know of )that all electricity got shut off (up to 15 min each or so each time), which probably ruined some food in the refrigerator. This might be beyond the owner's control, but something we noticed while we were there.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our stay in Francesco's place - can't beat the location.",

The home has everything you could need... beach chairs, snorkel gear, boogie boards, tons of towels, extra pillows, extra sheets and blankets, pots, pans, coffee maker and much more. Home is right on the shore, but you can easily access the beach to the left or right (just a short walk). Snorkeling out front was wonderful. Lots of fish and we even saw sea turtles. My grandma wasn't able to snorkel, but she loved sitting on the Lanai watching the waves with beautiful views of the islands across (I think it is both Molokai AND Lanai?). She even got to see a sea turtle right out front! Francesco was very helpful, friendly and quick to respond with anything we needed. Location was unbeatable too! Close to Front Street in Lahaina, Grocery store 3 minutes away, lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance. It was close to everything but still quiet and private. My family loved Maui and we're already planning our trip for 2019 and hoping to stay at Francescos place again! Thanks again for letting us stay at your beautiful Maui home!",

It's located within a quick walking distance of a 24-hour CVS, plenty of restaurants, a Metro Station, local markets and parks, and we always felt safe walking around together, even late at night. She's a very pleasant host and was quick to communicate with us whenever we had questions during our stay. I would absolutely book here again! Thank you, Molly!",

Bed is comfy, shower is hot - what more could you want :)\n\nIf you don't mind walking up lots of steps and steep hills, you can easily see many of the main HK Island sights on foot. If walking isn't your thing, there's plenty of public transport options reasonably close.\n\nThis place is really slap bang in the middle of things - close to restaurants, bars, cafes, supermarkets, shopping centres.\n\nIt's a great place to base yourself, particularly if you're only there for a short trip, like were.\n\nWarning though: the area is very steep!

For a straight-shot to the Sheng Wan station, take a couple long flights of stairs. If you have luggage & want to avoid that, use the Central station (or Uber) but keep in mind it is always very crowded there. \n\nApartment was spacious for Hong Kong standards. Shower pressure was strong & stayed hot through long hair washing. Living room has surround sound system & English channels to watch TV. There's an extra closet room for hanging clothes. \n\nOverall, great place to stay as compared to other HK apartments. \n\nAlso note, not all amenities at Dan's place are for communal use. This was not listed under House Rules nor noted anywhere. I was surprised to receive a note after check-out that an already open beverage was not for share although fridge was listed as an amenity. Through dozens of stays on Airbnb, this was my first experience encountering such an issue. Just use caution here.",

If you once find this place, you will relalise how close it is from Soho, but getting here for the first time wasn't very easy for us. I stayed here with my husband and my brother's family and the place was spacious enough (considering its hongkong) for us all to hang around. You need to walk up to the 4th floor but wasn't a problme at all to us. \nWe had some issue about electricity but Melanie responded quickly and helped us sort out the problem. One thing we felt inconvenient was hot shower but we got used to it later. And, it was very considerate of Melanie to prepare three heaters for us. \nI highly recommend this place for a family or groups of 4-5 ppl and especially those who wish to enjoy the atmosphere of Soho area and lankwaifong. I and my husband went out for a drink every night and found awesome bars and restaurants. We could have done it easily as the place is so close to it. \n",

The pool has been perfect for our grandson who is turning 4- he can go underwater and still stand up! We’ve all taken the kitchen scraps to the pig and watched him dominate, used the swings, clothesline, and have great praise for the outside bathroom. There is a high minded curatorial process going on here. Everything feels as if it were chosen for a use in this dreamy world of a bygone time. Thank you for making it possible for us to be here for 6 nights. I am so appreciative of your vision, this feeling of old Hawaii.\nSincerely and with Aloha,\nAnna Marie Hamilton",

The large underground parking is well lit, clean and roomy making manouvering our car very easy. It has direct elevator access to the apartment above, so unloading and loading the car was very convenient.\n\nThe area around the apartment has stores, restaurants, a Mercadona Supermarket, and many smaller grocery stores. The sidewalks are broad and evenly graded which makes for easy walking, and clean.\n\nPublic buses are frequent and easy to use, and there is an underground Metro station nearby within easy walking distance.\n\nDavid was what I would call a super host. His apartment was well equipped with every modern convenience and very clean. It was also very well stocked with food; bread, milk, juice, fresh fruit, butter, coking oil, etc., including a bottle of wine.\n\nHe patiently and carefully explained the works of every appliance in the apartment, including the use of the television features, and he made sure you are aware that he is available for any question later on. Communicating in English was not a problem.\n\nWe greatly appreciated the considerable time he spent providing us with detailed explanation of all the major attractions of Barcelona and how to get there. His Guest Guidebook includes all the details one could possibly ever need while in Barcelona, from managing emergency situations, using public transport, maps, to restaurants, shops, museums and all major attractions. Our visit to Barcelona was made much easier because of the book, and we learned a lot more.\n\nWe would recommend anyone visiting Barcelona to use David's place. We will definitely return to David's apartment if we should want to visit Barcelona again. The five days we were there were not enough.\n",

Nos recibió con comida, vino y muchos otros artefactos que fueron indispensables en nuestra estadía allí (shampoo, pasta de dientes, elementos de limpieza). No solo eso sino que también, se tomó el tiempo para explicarnos los lugares que no nos podíamos perder, y los restaurantes a cuales ir.  Fue un placer para nosotros poder conocerlo, y estamos seguros que en nuestros próximos viajes a Barcelona, contactar a David será nuestra primera opción. \n\nEn fin, nuestra estadía en Barcelona fue asombrosa, y gran parte fue gracias a David.

It is no surprise that the owner has been awarded the Tripadvisor Certificate of Excellence.  \n\nDavid keeps in touch, checking in to see if/what there is anything we need, in addition to recommending places to visit.  It's not just lip service.  For example, we suggested he consider adding a mat in the bathtub, which could be a bit slippery.  Later that day, DONE.\n\nFor example, when it was was time to vacate after our ten-day stay, we asked if would do us the favour of arranging for a mini-van to pick us up at 5:30am, as we were taking a train on to San Sebastian, and couldn't risk any misunderstanding if we tried booking this ourselves.  After checking around, David came back with an answer.  The going rate was too high and he was still looking to find us much more reasonable transportation.  He DID.\n\nThis beautifully decorated, two-bedroom apartment is everything as described, well-equipped, well-stocked, clean and comfortable with a lovely balcony and close to all amenities.  \n\nDo we recommend it, most definitely YES.",

One of the main reasons we chose the apartment was the great reviews that David received as a host.  It turned out that those reviews didn't do him justice.  From the moment I booked, David made sure to stay in contact with us to ensure that we would be fully prepared for our Barcelona experience.  He even offered to pick us up at the airport!  Upon arrival, David gave us a car tour of the city and took us to some out of the way sights that we would have otherwise missed.  The day before we were leaving, I received a message from David offering to drop us back at the  airport.   He went above and beyond to make sure that our time in Barcelona was as wonderful as possible.  David is the ultimate host and I can't recommend him highly enough.",

Do note the small details like that there is (currently) no wifi & no lift, but we knew about these so we were prepared for it. One small thing, the curtains are quite sheer over the full-length windows which makes the whole place bright & airy, but if you're used to sleeping in darkness then I recommend bringing eyeshades.",

It has been nicely renovated and has the comfort you would want. It's spacious for a stay with two people. Most of the interior is new and functions properly. This is complemented by nice (and some antique) decorative details.\nA pleasant surprise was the smell of freshly baked bread every morning in the staircase. The downstairs neighbour is a bakery where you can get good and cheap bread and your morning espresso.\n\nWe have had contact with Teresa through AirBNB, she has been helpful and kind. Tim welcomed us with a gastronomic surprise and even a list of suggestions for our stay in Porto. They are a very hospitable and helpful couple!\n\nThank you Teresa and Tim!",

                "txt": "This was my first trip to Hawaii and having used Airbnb successfully before, I was looking forward to our stay! While I can usually overlook most shortcomings, the list was too many to ignore here. Wide angle pictures & professionally written listing descriptions will impress most - however, here are some takes from my REAL customer experience at the 414 condo:\n\n\"We will provide you with a special code to access the condo after you are booked and paid in full.\"\n\n- After a 13 day stay, we were charged a \"half day rate\" for a late checkout for 5 hours over our contracted stay. During our last day, we ended up being locked out of the condo. Thankfully the late checkout fee was refunded due to this situation. Not quite the goodbye from our paradise as we hoped for.\n\n\"This unit includes a window A/C in the living room should you need it although we find it is rarely needed because the tradewinds keep you comfortable.\"\n\n- The AC unit is a measly 12\" by 32\" window unit that had trouble keeping even the living room & kitchen areas cool. If 86 degrees in your bedroom while sleeping is \"comfortable\", then this might be the place for you.\n\n\"This setting is wonderful for romantic sunset strolls. For the more active person this is a great beach to run on as you can do so for miles in peace away from the crowds.\"  -- \"Three miles of quiet sandy beach will entice you to walk, run, or build sand castles.\"\n\n- Haycraft Park is roughly 500 feet away from the beach directly in front of this condo, and it was filled with people every day. Half the time we were here, there were campers there who stayed all day and over night with big fish lines across the entire beach. There may be other listings with better seclusion. \n\n\"This unit is spacious and bright.\"\n\n- Spacious? That's a stretch. But bright? You're absolutely spot on. If you enjoy sleeping in the dark, this place might NOT be for you. Waking up at 530am is ideal for the lighting of this condo, ever with the window shades (which many times had trouble coming down since they are on automatic motors). \n\nA POSITIVE NOTE:\nOne thing I cannot get over is the real Mahalo spirit of everyone staying and living at the Kana'i A Nalu resort. While my mother in law and 16 month old daughter got locked out on the last day, many guests there offered help, water, and to hang in their condos while we tried to wait patiently to get back in. The resort has an amazing location and even better spirit within its guests. \n",

The parking is a little misrepresented in the current listing, as it is several blocks away and during 90% of our stay, it was occupied by an unauthorized vehicle. We asked Tyler about this, and he said he couldn't do anything to make them move. There was also an air mattress available, but no pump or linens to go with it so we couldn't use it. Overall, we enjoyed staying in this area (lots of great shops and restaurants, close to the Centre Bell if you're attending an event) and the apartment is beautiful, but we had constant headaches arise from the parking situation. I'd have given a higher rating had the listing been more specific in this regard or had the situation been resolved more to our satisfaction.",

We thought it will disappear if we open the back door(no windows), but it became worse(there might be some restaurants close to the backyard). We report this to Tyler, he didn't reply, so we told his friend and then he was arguing with us and he said that I am complaining for no reason. He even suggested me to buy a refresher in Dollar store! \n\nWe were very upset, not only the bad smell, but also the dirty old quilt. We tried to take a nap, but people live on the second floor were laughing so loud and traffic outside was noisy. So we decided to move to a hotel. I asked Tyler about this, he didn't reply, but he sent another friend to reply us that he will give us full refund, and we can leave the key in the room then move to a hotel. But after we arrived at the hotel, Tyler finally replied us and said he won't refund us! I tried to communicate with him but he just disappeared again!\n\nWe already reported this to Airbnb, one warning to the future guest: never trust the pictures!!",

But it meant we made the most of the wonderful harbour beach down the stairs. \nWould highly recommend Beach Escape to large groups. ",

Thursday was my actual birthday and this almost had us packing up and heading home - we were minutes away from cancelling the weekend as we had no way of getting in to the house we had booked for 12 guests. We then get inside and everyone starts to arrive and we all shower and use the toilets. By the time we come out the smell of raw sewage is so unbearable that we can't use the balcony for the dinner we had planned or open any windows on a hot day in a house that has no air con (not that air con was ever listed or promised however). The smell only got worse throughout the weekend as we continued to use the bathrooms. 6 out of 12 guests chose to leave on Friday as a result - ruining the weekend we had planned for my birthday. Two of the couples who left had travelled interstate for this. So they had paid for 3 nights and only got to stay 1 in rooms that stunk of sewage. This could have and should have been resolved on Friday or Saturday - but no solution was offered and we were expected to stay in a house that stunk of sewage. On top of this on Friday, as we bring items down from the car into the house we place two cases on a shelf along the kitchen wall and it comes off completely and lands on my foot. After looking at how it was constructed, a 30-50kg shelf was screwed together by 4 small screws and was never constructed to hold any sort of weight, making it a danger to guests. And lastly, the alarm. At 2.30am on the Saturday morning the house alarm (that we had been told did not work) began going off and woke everyone in the house. The four surrounding suburbs encountered a blackout and as a result the alarm went to auxiliary power and then went into alarm (the blackout is obviously not the owners fault) The alarm continued to go off for an hour and there was no information anywhere as to how to make it stop. We were left to figure this out for ourselves. The number we called inside the panel had no idea, the host was not contactable and the lady he put us in touch with suggested \"we push a couple of buttons\". The house should not have been rented out with the sewage pump the way it was and the host should have information on hand for his alarm system. We know that the host MAY not have known the pump was broken, but we did make him aware as soon as we noticed it within a couple of hours of arriving and no solution was offered for the three day stay. If we had...",

Best location for anyone who wants the easiest access to all types of transportation for work or for leisure. As for parents like us travelling with an elderly and two active young children, Wilson's apartment is the best to meet our needs. Not only it is so clean and safe for kids, its convenient location allows us to return for nap and rest when kids are tired between our busy holiday schedules. Wilson is so approachable and very thoughtful in many details.\r\nClean linens, towels, kitchenware, clothes washing powder, indoor storable clothes liner, refills of every consumable daily essential items eg toilet papers, tissues etc.\r\nThere are some stairs upon entry into lobby/lift of the building but it is a very common feature in Hong Kong. You can open the French-door-type glass doors fully before you enter with big luggages. The building guards/administrators on duty are very friendly too.\r\nSurprisingly, it's so quiet and comfortable to sleep, considering its prime location in one of the busiest parts of Hong Kong. Eating, shopping, sightseeing...all within walking distance or so easy for additional transportation when preferred.\r\nThank you for making our stay in Hong Kong so memorable.\r\nStrongly recommended!",

The location was great it was close to the MTR/public transportation, restaurants, market, etc... The only con to the location is that it was a little hard to get a taxi because coming out of the building cars are not allowed to stop in that area so you would have to walk a bit when taking/coming from a taxi. This has nothing to do with wilson but I thought I would mention it anyways the elevator in this building is extremely slow. The apartment was decent, it didn't wow me or anything but as expected places in HK are small. For a group of 9 it was a bit tight but that didn't bother us since we were out most of the time. The apartment looks pretty much like the pictures there is one thing I would like to say is I wish Wilson would have taken pictures of the second bathroom to his place kus it was tiny. I'm a really tiny girl and even I had a hard time in there. So that probably would have changed my mind on picking his place to stay because we were really looking for a 2 bathroom place. I mean yes the small restroom is considered as 1 but it was so tiny that we didnt even use the shower in it kus it  was tiny but oh wells. Overall our stay was fine but I did feel like the floors could have been a bit more clean.  ",

Apartment very centrally located - 5 min walk from SOGO, 5 min walk to Times Square, etc. It is situated on top floor of a building that has businesses on the bottom 4 floors. Elevators are small and slow, and entrance is directly on a busy street. Wilson is a great host as he was quick to respond to our requests. One of the ACs broke down and was fixed the next day. Overall great stay - great alternative as opposed to staying at hotel for two weeks (we saved lots of money)",

Carmen keeps her place tidy and well equipped with everything you need. Bed is short (as others have noted) and the sofa is small too. Bathroom is basic but shower has hot water and ok pressure.

Some of visitors were too tall for the bed but with my 155cm height, I had no problem sleeping on it.  Hot water from shower was abundant. The view of skyscrapers from windows was good. I could even partly see New Years fireworks from windows. \n\nApartment concierges were at a ground floor 24 hours. They open the entrance door when you come home. Some of them can communicate in English. They are all kind and helpful.\n\nCarmen was super kind and communicative host. Her indication was accurate and helpful. She kindly left an octopus card for visitors to charge and use. \n\nThere is a washing machine in a listing but HongKong was too humid to dry laundry fast.  You can use a laundry shop next to the apartment. They wash and clean your laundry in a day.\n\nThe location was only a few minutes from a tram station. \nWalkable distance from Central and Causeway Bay. \n\nThere are many towns in HongKong but I am totally satisfied with staying in Wanchai. \nWanchai has modern skyscrapers, hipster attractions, and daily local markets and small restaurants.  St Francis street looked very sophisticated and I didn’t feel unsafe. In front of the apartment, there are rainbow stairs which looks like an Instagram shooting spot and a lot of foreign people were taking photos. If you are a vegetarian, I strongly recommend a restaurant “天然齋 Green Veggie” 15min from the apartment.",

Super market is two minutes walking from the apartment. Porto city center is a 15 minute bus ride away. Communication with the host was always fast and clear. We were even provided with a welcoming gift! \nThere are, however, two downsides: the apartment is not equipped with an airconditioner or fan (which is not disastrous, but it can get pretty hot if you're not used to Portugese summers), and sounds from upstairs neighbours and the busy road it lies on can be heard at night. If you're a light sleeper, I suggest taking soundproof earplugs with you. \nOtherwise, it's a beautiful apartment if you want to enjoy both the city center of Porto and the beach!",

Tirando isso uma estadia foi perfeita. Recomendamos.\nO apartamento é muito confortável, com uma vista ótima e muito bem equipado. As camas sao muito confortáveis.\nA equipa do Porto Concierge ofereceu-nos à chegada uma garrafa de água e de vinho para melhorar o ótimo serviço de acolhimento.\nVamos repetir!",

On the (minor) negative side, we thought a second set of keys should have been provided when the place is for two couples and you require the key to get out of the building. The washing machine did not tumble dry clothes so a dryer would have been handy. Last I had to fix the TV myself as it was not working, but in the end we never watched it anyway :-)",

Despite of my insistance he paid for my dinner, dessert a nice tea afterward and paid for the minibus to the shisha place. Frankly, it might have exceeded the rent I paid. I wanted to go to Kurdistan but non of information was available in English he called the bus company for me and then he came with me to the bus terminal then he barganed on my behalf and I got a cheaper ticket as the result. He didn't leave until he made sure I went on my bus safely. In my return also his friend came with me to Taksim to make sure that I'm getting the right bus to Sabiha airport. I highly recommand him if you want a host who is also your tour guide and freind. Also the prices in the shops are considerably cheaper near his place rather than touristic area like Taksim and you are a 2 TL away from Taksim, so his place is ideal in any sense.",

A nice variety of fruit and nuts was offered for breakfast. He provided my mum and her friend with a nice room with two single beds, they had also had a choice to sleep in separate rooms. The accommodation is clean with everything you need. It's quite close to the city center and cheap to get there with a transport card that Kubilay provides. Kubilay is an open-minded well-travelled person who will give you all necessary information on sightseeing and not only. Though my mum doesn't speak English, he managed to explain to her where to find traditional hammam and massage so she and her friend were very happy. Thanks for a great stay, Kubilay!\r\n\r\nЗамечательный заботливый хозяин! Четко объяснил, как проехать к нему от аэропорта, встретил у метро, был все время на связи. Комнаты чистые со всем необходимым. Кубилай предоставил моей маме и ее подруге выбор: спать в одной комнате с 2-мя кроватями или в разных комнатах. Несмотря на то, что моя мама не говорит по-английски, Кубилай сумел объяснить ей, где находится хамам и массаж, чем она была очень довольна! Расположение квартиры удобное, добираться до центра легко и недорого с транспортной картой, которую предоставляет Кубилай. На завтрак Кубилай предложил нам фрукты, орехи, сыр и вкусный чай со сладостями. Спасибо ему большое за радушный прием, информационную поддержку и готовность помочь в любую минуту!",

The place is nice, fully renovated, and very well located, in the heart of McGill Ghetto.  It's very lively with all the students setting up for the school year.  There are a lot of ammenities close by and the location is quite central.  Overall, a very nice stay.",

Le logement est propre, confortable et bien équipé (bonne connection internet; lave linge & sèche linge; bureau pour travailler...). La chambre  est plutôt spacieuse. Le rapport qualité prix est très bien selon moi. J'ai pu profiter de la terrasse sur le toit avant qu'il ne fasse trop froid. L'appartement est bien situé, il y a des parcs et des rues marchande pas très loin, les autres rues marchande ne sont pas très loin non plus, j'y allais souvent à pied (Mont Royal que j'aime bien est à 30min de marche). Il y a de bon restaurant et de très bon café à moins de 5 minutes de marche. Le metro est à environ à 10-15 minutes. Il y à aussi une station de vélo et une bonne épicerie à quelque minutes.\r\nLe quartier est sympa, la rue est calme. Pour ceux qui veulent faire du shopping ou du lèche vitrine il faudra surement prendre le metro pour aller un peu plus loin. Mais facilement accessible avec le metro.\r\nTrès bonne première expérience airbnb. \r\n",

                "txt": "Снимали номер с 3 по 9 ноября 2017 втроем - 2 взрослых и ребенок 9 лет. \nМестоположение и район.\nНайти гостиницу очень просто. Если добираетесь сами, то выходить надо на трамвайной остановке Баязит, перейти на другую улицу, найти вывеску Burger King  и по этой улочке идти прямо вниз, никуда не сворачивая, ища вывеску гостиницы (она будет справа). \nТеперь о самом районе. Гостиница находится на торговой и оживленной улице. Первое впечатление - как будто ты попала на рынок, становится тревожно. Но потом уже понимаешь, что собственно это не совсем рынок - это магазины по оптовой торговле обувью. Я несколько раз проходила по этой улочке одна - все нормально - никто меня за руки не хватал, никуда не зазывал - здесь люди торгуют оптом, потому я как покупатель не особо интересна. Прогулка по этой улице до гостиницы занимает минуты 3. Зато поднявшись до трамвайной остановке Баязит, ты попадаешь сразу в исторический центр (Гранд Базар) и можешь прогуляться по одной из самых красивых улиц старого Константинополя. Пешком минут за 10 (может меньше, очень близко) доходим до площади Султанахмет, где в вашем распоряжении сразу несколько достопримечательностей - Храм Святой Софии, Цистерна Базилика, Голубая мечеть, колонны, рядом тоже Дворец Топкапы. Так что в плане местоположения гостиницы - все очень хорошо. И - ночью тихо, никто не мешает спать. В  5 утра кажется проходит молитва - её слышно, но еле-еле, я просто чутко сплю. Мы жили в номере 401 - на верхнем этаже. Из окна открывается вид на Мраморное море со множеством кораблей и крыши соседних домов.\nЗавтраки.\nКаждый день одинаковые, но очень вкусные. Из горячего - яйца, картофель фри, омлет кажется (вроде без молока, не знаю, но вкусно), чай, кофе. Нарезки - огурцы, помидоры, оливки, маслины, 2 вида сыра, колбаса-ветчина, жареные кабачки и перцы, йогурт, хлопья. В кувшинах молоко и еще что-то типа цветного разведенного сока.\nНомер.\nКартинка соответствует полностью нами увиденному. Мебель неновая, но красивая и добротная, и видно, что дорогая. Матрасы толстые и удобные. Белье чистое и не пахнет хлоркой. Могу только добавить, что есть еще мини-бар, чайник электрический и чашки с блюдцами, тройник (поразительно!).  В ванне на троих человек - 5 тюбиков геля и один шампуня, три кусочка мыла и туалетная бумага. Полотенца также предоставляются. Есть сейф, проверили - работает, я так поняла он предоставляется бесплатно....вот только его к шкафу забыли прикрутить -\n спокойно взял под мышку и пошел. Посторонних и неприятных запахов нет.\nВ целом.\nГостиница очень приятная, тихая, уютная. Соотношения цена-качество оптимальное. Рекомендую данную гостиницу.",

When we came to check in he said our room was taken and we were to move to another location.  First off, not cool, secondly he didn't offer to give us anything in return for this major inconvenience.  The other place was not up to our standards and we requested a refund which he made in cash.  This was kind of him, but still we want things to run smoothly.  Vacationing is amazing, but it's a costly affair that always adds additional stresses and one stress we like to avoid is accommodation issues.",

Walking distance from Maalaea Harbour which is great if you book any sea tours/excursions leaving from the harbour. Beautiful immaculate condo, cozy, very clean and well equipped. Quiet building and location. Easy and quick check-in, clear communication with the host who is quick to reply. Detailed instructions sent by email before our arrival were very helpful. Short drive to Kihei, Lahaina and Kahului Airport. Affordable and worth every penny. We will definitely return to Maui one day and hope to be able to stay here again.",

Restaurants and shops and aquarium are walkable, and most of the spots on the island you want to be at are no more than 20 minutes away by car. We found the location so convenient and flexible, and were able to do everything we wanted. \n\nThe space is even nicer than it looks in the photos, immaculately kept and with everything you could want. It even has tons of goodies for cooking - salts and spices and even olive oil! The box of beach goodies - chairs, boogie boards, a cooler - were super handy and we used them a ton, saved us money too. \n\nIf you're worried about not having a beach view, don't be. The mountain view is gorgeous, and you can walk to the beach in minutes. \n\nMahalo, Ralph! We'd stay here again <3",

Les' cabin... arriving there after a long day of solo travel in planes and cars I felt like I found a sanctuary. \nThe cabin is very tidy, and everything is new and well maintained. The bed firm and very comfortable, I slept very well the three nights I was there. \nAlthough Rev Les informed me of possible daytime farm equipment noises, I never heard them as I was gone most of the days. The nights were quiet except for occasional rains when windows must be closed, there is a fan that keeps things cool and air circulating. This area of the Big Island is lush and tropical and with that beauty comes an abundance of life, so attention must be taken when preparing or storing any kind of food, as the ants will be quick to make an appearance. Sweet Hawi town is nearby with all its charms, and has a lovely Saturday farmer's market under the shade of a massive banyon tree. The fresh organic farm eggs Rev Les left for me were so appreciated, and the kitchen did provide for all I needed to fry them up for a delicious (Website hidden by Airbnb) were the kind and helpful communications I received from Rev Les. Mahalo for a delightful first stay on the Big Island! c:",

The lanai has the most breathtaking view I have ever had the privilege of experiencing.  Sherry and Shane were more than accommodating and made the arrival extremely easy.  They have everything you could think of needing at your finger tips.   They go above and beyond for their guests.  They respond immediately if you have an inquiry, and they have a homemade binder full of detailed information, including points of interests and restaurants to dine at. \r\nMy husband and I are humbled by their graciousness as hosts. We could not be more content with our stay here!!\r\nMahalo!",

You can enjoy an unobstructed view of the setting sun from the balcony while enjoying your dinner and/or a glass of wine/beer/whatever. You can go for a spontaneous swim in the sea, which is only a few steps away from your room.  Sometimes you can even see sea turtles in the water in front of the condo.\n\nThe apartment is perfectly equipped. You'll find everything you need for cooking, doing your laundry, going to the beach (beach towels, beach bags, a cool bag, beach chairs, etc.) and more.\n\nWe will definitely return to Maui in the near future and we hope that we can stay at Sherry's and Shane's condo again. We strongly recommend staying at their condo!",

Txus's apartment is located in a quiet area that is close to some of the major tourist attractions (15min walk to Sagrada Familia, 15 min to Casa Milà, 20min to Park Güell) and has several metro stations nearby if one is feeling lazy. It is basically a shared flat where you can use the room appointed, living room (with a balcony), kitchen and bathroom. Everything was very clean and nice (way better that in the pictures). The room we stayed in was not very big, but it had everything we needed. Txus is very nice and helpful and made us feel really welcomed. Would totally recommend! ",

Desiree thought of all the little special touches - from fresh fruit and sparkling water to chocolates and flowers.  The location is fantastic - walking distance to all that Sydney has to offer.   Her guide book and restaurant recommendations were wonderful.  Highly recommended  - better than any hotel stay!  We  will be back again!  Many thanks Desiree",

Kihei market was merely a 2 minute walk away as was the surf school where you can rent out paddle boards or surf boards and other gear. Since it is centrally located, driving to other places in Maui was also convenient. \n\nHospitality was outstanding - we knew where we wanted to go but the apt had a Maui guide book on the coffee table for quick reference. There were great amenities to play Music, a nice bookshelf with various reads if you just want to read by the beach and chairs to take to the beach  to relax in between your snorkeling/swimming excursions. \n\nThe views - oh my god. The photos do not do it justice. We had sweeping views of the pacific and saw early morning paddle-boarders, surfers and sea turtles right from the balcony! Im sure if you come during the winter months, you can watch whales literally while drinking your morning coffee. No need to go to an expensive touristy bar to get that perfect Hawaiian sunset :) \n\nI don't know what else to say. Highly recommend for a great time.",

The heritage house, very well loved by the owners, is all at once comfortable/cosy, charming and full of wonders… some delicious like: fresh herbs, lemon/orange trees growing in the garden. The'Platypus\" bedroom with its timber walls, vintage lacy mosquito net, clean bed linen & soft towels, made us feel very snug. Ann had even placed some fresh lavender stems on our pillows! We explored the island during the day, hanged at the beach… It felt like the time had stopped for a while. Then, coming back to the house, we were welcomed at night by Ann cooking up a FEAST, literally. She put so much thoughts into the menu and what would please us! The dinner with Ann and her husband was lovely and very much fun. Needless to say that we slept like babies.

Ann does a great talk on the history of the island.\r\n\r\nIf you think you'll need a little sleep in, take earplugs as the local birds get excited in the morning.

We had booked and paid correctly, it appears there may have been a problem with the Air BNB site. However, from this point on staying there became very uncomfortable.\nOver the next couple of days there were more problems. She could not tell us the wifi password, so we were unable to use the wifi. She told us we could not use the air conditioning. Finally, she refused us access to the kitchen to heat up our dinner, and told us we could not eat in the house, so we ended up eating cold pies in the garden at night. \nIt was so uncomfortable we decided to leave early, and did not stay the last night. \n",

We found it very peaceful and relaxing, and great for an afternoon nap after a long walk!\r\n\r\nThe apartment was clean, quiet, open, and airy, there was free wifi and Netflix, and basic kitchen amenities, including a coffee maker. We enjoyed getting some bread, fruit, and veggies from Marché Jean-Talon and having them for breakfast. \r\n\r\nI would gladly stay here again, so I guess that's the best recommendation!",

Walking distance to anything and so many options for shopping, food, patios, etc. The space is so cute and trendy just as described. They offer so many amenities in the kitchenette and bathroom so you don’t have to run out for the little things you might need. Very quiet inside the space. Check in involved walking to a nearby location to get the key from a lockbox but was manageable. Thx again !",

When i check the location, had to cancel and rushed to my ultimate accommodation portal, broadcasting generic message to nearby hosts to secure an accommodation the soonest.\r\n\r\nAlison was among the first to reply, and to pre-confirm...\r\nBy the time i got there, Adam was already waiting for me and even kind enough to give me all the directions at 8am and off course waited for me outside to make sure that i'm paying the right cab fee. \r\n\r\nWhat can i say Adam, made feel at home from very first moment, kind, genuine and warm welcoming host. The house is is really nice fully refurbished, in a quite and well connected neighbourhood. My room was upstairs, a nice sunny room with  a queen bed and a bathroom attached. After i dropped in my luggage, Adam gave me guided orientation tour to the house, with access to all amenities. \r\n\r\nFelt like a VIP 5 star treatment as Adam even gave me a pre-paid bus ticket, which made my first(s) bus rides easier as some stations are pre-paid only.  So now that you that i have been at a great apartment, with great hosts, that's all, Rozelle is a really nice neighbourhood. walking distance from my hosts' place, you can make it to the main street packed, with cafe, bars and restaurant, a vibrant market and lot of attractions. if you happen to stay over a weekend don't miss Rozelle Market (Sat & Sun). \r\n\r\nNow the funny part, Adam was so happy to receive me as he's a all star backgammon player and he knows that Lebanese people are really good at that and he was so eager for round. One night we decided to play a round and Adam's expectations went all down the drain, i think i was the first Lebanese ever to be clumsy backgammon player. We agree that we will play another time via (Hidden by Airbnb) and i will have support from fellow Lebanese players :)\r\n\r\nAll in all, i great time, the house is warm, clean, and comfortable and the hosts are simply AWESOME  \r\n\r\n ",

Since the appartment is in the city center there is no fabulos view from none of the windows - but this does not matter at all.\r\n \r\nThere is also a Nespresso coffee machine in the modern kitchen (bring the capsules by your one or there is a Nespresso shop 100m away).\r\n \r\nWe can fully recomand this special appartment and Lluis as perfect host in this wunderful city.\r\nMuchos gracias Lluis!!\r\n \r\nMarcella and familiy\r\n\r\n *   * \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDas Appartment ist in unmittelbarer Nähe vom öffentlichen Verkehr und der grossen Einkaufsstrasse \"Passeig de Gràcia\" mit unzähligen Läden, Cafes und Restaurants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIdeal für einen Sightseeing-Aufenthalt in Barcelona, da zentral gelegen (ca. 10 min zu Fuss zur Plaça Catalunya, 2 min zum Taxi-Stand und Bus-Haltestellen).\r\n\r\n\r\nWir waren zu 5. für drei Tage in Lluis Wohnung und haben uns sofort sehr wohl gefühlt. Lluis war bei der Schlüsselübergabe bereits vor Ort und hat uns gute Tipps für Barcelona gegeben. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDie Wohnung ist neu renoviert, modern eingerichtet und hat wunderschöne alte Böden und Stuckaturen in manchen Zimmern.\r\n\r\nEs hat eine automatische Lüftung: Die Temperatur kann manuell eingestellt werden (sehr angenehm).\r\n\r\nDer verglaste Raum („Wintergarten“) ist ein zusätzlicher Raum mit Aussicht auf den Innenhof (die Aussicht ist jetzt nicht wirklich atemberaubend, aber es ist sehr gemütlich). Eine schöne Aussicht gibt es von keinem Fenster aus, da sich die Wohnung Mitten in der Stadt befindet - Stört aber nicht.\r\n\r\nEs hat eine Nespresso-Kaffee-Maschine (Kapseln selber mitbringen oder 100m von der Wohnung gibt’s einen Nespresso-Shop).\r\n\r\n\r\nWir können die Wohnung und Lluis als Gastgeber nur weiterempfehlen.\r\n\r\nMuchos gracias Lluis!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nMarcella and familiy\r\n",

Public transportation is within walkable distance too. \nPlease note that you will need to buy some necessities such as trash bags, shampoos and so on as this is not an apartment that someone currently lives in (more of a hotel style with an empty furnished room). Also the streets could be a little loud at night because it faces to Madison Avenue. The service calls were handled promptly. Check in and out were easy. \nOverall I enjoyed my stay at this apartment and would recommend it to anyone who prefers a convenient location but not right into midtown where the traffics are. ",

Wifi and cable TV works well too.\n\nI had no problems with the hot water in the shower, but do note that it does take a few minutes for it to get hot. \n\nCommunication was great and the host, he was always quick to respond to questions or any problems.

Third, the apartment faces Madison Ave, so it is rather loud. In addition, the windows are not well sealed so it gets cold/hot easily. Overall, considering what you get, the apartment is overpriced.

Yo mismo vivo en un edificio antiguo.el apartamento estaba limpio excepto por la nevera, que tuvimos que limpiarla a fondo\nCalefacción y aire acondicionado. Muy necesarios los dos porque las temperaturas son un poco extremas.\nWiFi muy bueno, Potente (llegaba hasta la parada del autobús) y muy veloz. Televisión con múltiples canales\nLos quince primeros días estuvimos cuatro personas (mis dos hijos) y estuvimos un poco justos (sofá-cama) pero después una pareja, y perfecto.\nLe vendría bien al apartamento una mano de pintura.\nEs tuvimos mes y medio y NYC es maravilloso, el sitio y el apartamento me encanto, salvo pequeñas cosas, y el anfitrion fue muy amable ya que nos dejó hacer el check out a la 1:00 pm.\nLa comunicación fue siempre por email",

The room itself was super clean, comfortable and perfect for a short holiday in Hong Kong. It had everything I needed - AC, little bathroom with shower, fresh towel everyday, shampoo and a big comfortable bed. You also feel really safe as you can only get into the guesthouse and room with a special keycard. The staff was super helpful too and so was Natalie. I only met her in person once, but she is incredibly friendly and really makes sure you have a pleasant stay. I can recommend the guesthouse for those who travel by themselves and need a quiet room to come back to in the midst of bustling Hong Kong. Thanks a lot, Natalie! All the best, Juliana",

We stayed as a couple for just over a month and miss it already. Paul showed us around the neighbourhood when we first got there and was easily contactable thereafter.\r\n\r\nPaul's place is a unique gem decorated with his quirky eye for colour, style and collectible treasures. It has a cozy well decked out living room, a bedroom with a closet and a comfortable bed, spacious bathroom and a nice, sunny, open-plan kitchen surrounded by windows. It is neat and well organised. There is cooling and heating in every room (plus fans), and the kitchen is well stocked with pots, pans, and other requirements along with a nice big fridge and freezer.  We found the place had everything we needed for a comfortable long-term stay.\r\n\r\nFor us, the location so close to three big parks (incl. Central Park), Columbia and Harlem, was just right. There are transport options aplenty: bikes up and down Riverside Park, the 1 MTA line two blocks away and frequent Broadway buses.  Paul kindly lent us his two bikes which was a fab way to get around the city. Being located on the border of UWS is great as it is a relatively quiet area to stay but the rest of Manhattan is readily accessible through the 1 line meaning we got the best of Manhattan action combined with good sleeping! Would stay again in a flash!",

I was in NYC for 2 weeks at Columbia and the location was just a few blocks away. I didn't want to deal with transit in the AM, although that would not have been a big issue anyway.  Plus, it's right off broadway (the broadway that has shows) so subways access was great. Since it's a college town, I felt super safe and there were minimal tourists and minimal bums also. A couple things to note: this is actually Paul's residence so there are some personal affects to be mindful of.  I really appreciated that though because I was able to tap into the Tylenol and bandaids in the medicine cabinet over the course of 2 weeks. Hey, anything can happen!  He was totally respectful of my privacy and wasn't popping in or out during my stay.  I'm hopeful that if Teachers college has anymore trainings that I get to go to, Paul's place is available!",

The location is outstanding. Such a lovely upper west side block, across the street and around the corner from Columbia. I was visiting my son who is a student there. Even if Columbia wasn't your destination, Paul's apartment is one block from lovely Riverside Park and the Hudson River. Morningside park is a few blocks to the east. Central Park North and Cathedral Parkway are 5-10 minutes away. The 1 train stops 2-4 blocks away. The UWS is very gracious. The pace is less frenetic which is a nice thing at the end of a day of NYC touring. Yet the nearness of Columbia gives the neighborhood a youthful hip vibe. And Columbia's campus is outstanding; lovely and compact. I felt safe coming and going from Paul's building. The building was well maintained. The hallway outside his door wasn't dark and depressing. There is a laundry in the basement and a garbage chute in the hall on his floor. Paul's apartment is decorated with an artist's eye; the furniture, art, even the plates and skillets, were beautiful, colorful, special. The kitchen/sitting room was filled with light! Everything was in its place. My bedroom had a very big, comfortable bed. The bed linens were soft; the colors were muted and restful. There was plenty of drawer and closet space. The table lighting was exceptional. I had a lovely view of a church and Columbia outside my bedroom window. Paul was so kind to welcome me very early due to my 5a arrival into JFK on a red eye from SF. He was quickly responsive when I requested my stay. He met me and welcomed me into his home. He made me tea, fruit and nuts. He gave me plenty of towels and wash clothes. He gave me a shelf in the bathroom for my toiletries. I unpacked, showered (plenty of hot water), and headed out to my first meeting. Paul was lovely to talk to, yet respectful of my privacy. He welcomed both of my young adult children into his home. My daughter (who is graduating from NYU) cooked 2 breakfasts in Paul's kitchen. She so enjoyed his window seat in his kitchen. My son lingered and did schoolwork at the kitchen table. Paul's space was so much more gracious than a dorm room! Paul even printed out my boarding pass when I was out and about. He also printed 36 pages of work that I had completed while spending the day in the libraries at Columbia and the cafes near Columbia while my son wrote a paper. Making that personal connection with Paul enhanced my stay. But he was so quiet and gracious that guests who want to keep to themselves would also be comfortable. My son has 3 more years at Columbia and...",

Even after we left, she informed us of an item we had left behind, and offered to help send it to us. Please visit us in Dhaka, Aybike!",

Next day she knocked and had 2 beach chairs on her shoulder, not the flimsy ones, the good ones....we thought that was incredible. The place is not the Hyatt, but comfy and clean. Our room was big enough for us,shower and toilet in the room, all was perfect. We could use the kitchen, which we did every morning. Well, what else is there to say? I told her, whenever we visit Maui, we will stay with her. She gave me/us a bye-bye present: Lilikoi candle, soap and body wash....a Hyatt would not do that !!\r\nMahalo Rina, you are a wonderful Host, Franz and Renate\r\n",

Falta de limpieza absoluta en toda la casa que hacía muy incómoda su estancia y más con niños pequeños. El sofá donde supuestamente se podía dormir, tenía una gran mancha que ni se habían molestado en intentar limpiarla. Solo había un único armario recubierto de moho para guardar la ropa, que evidentemente no pudimos utilizar. La ducha estaba negra, picada y oxidada, lo que nos tocó limpiar a nosotros y desinfectarla un poco para poderla utilizar. La cocina llena cubierta por una capa de grasa que la hacía inútil para cocinar cualquier cosa. Escaleras hacia abajo completamente empinadas y estrechas.  Nada más llegar ni rastro de Regina o Juan, nos atendió una persona que ni siquiera sabía hablar bien castellano, por lo que dudo mucho de la existencia de Juan y Regina. Es absolutamente indignante que cuando pagas el apartamento te cobran unos gastos de limpieza que no han efectuado. Para colmo nos cobraron 30 € en concepto de checking. La zona es tranquila aunque bastante alejada del metro, dado que tienes unas cuestas muy empinadas desde la parada más cernada de metro y luego toca subir cuesta arriba unos 15 minutos. De cara a los esfuerzos por parte del anfitrión, absolutamente ninguno. La persona que nos recibió ni siquiera sabía indicarnos donde estaba la tienda más cercana, un parking donde poder dejar el coche e incluso la parada de metro más cernada. Soy usuario de esta web desde hace tiempo, he visitado otros países de Europa usándola y ha sido con creces la peor experiencia que he tenido. Me siento completamente estafado.",

Il manque cependant un tapis de douche pour la baignoire.\r\nLes matelas étaient confortables et le quartier très calme mis à part un voisin qui mettait parfois de la musique à fond.\r\nAu niveau de l'emplacement, le logement est très bien situé car à 10 minutes à pied d'une ligne de métro qui dessert tous les endroits importants de la ville (plage, centre ville, quartier gothique, etc).\r\nPar contre, attention pour les personnes qui ont des difficultés à se déplacer car le logement est tout en haut d'une côte très raide.\r\nMalgré tout, nous avons passé un agréable séjour dans ce logement et avons apprécié la terrasse ombragée.",

There's a big window besides the bed that brings in lots of natural light and there's even a TV in the room! Angela wasn't home the evening we stayed so we weren't able to converse more.

Jon arranged this in an uncomplicated manner.\r\n\r\nThe flat is very nice and functional furnished. All equipment is very new. The beds have comfortable mattresses in which we could sleep very well. In striking distance you will find bars and shops frequented by residents. Even the view from the small balcony over the roofs of Barcelona is a visit worth. A breath-taking view in Barcelona’s real life!\r\n\r\nWe recommend this apartment without retention and will rent it again for our next stay in this unique town.

Be aware there is no lift and 4 flights of stairs, but this didn't bother us as we needed the exercise",

She even carried my case up 4 flights of stairs as I had a knee injury.  Lots of local information and maps were provided.   The flat was just like the photographs - bright , clean and comfortable. Although small, it was well designed and felt spacious. The air con worked efficiently - much appreciated in the hot weather. It is in a fantastic friendly neighbourhood with lots of restaurants and small supermarkets - the cafe across the street was great for brunch and dinner.  We were able to walk easily to main sights or take the nearby metro. Olivia also gave us good tips and was easy to contact. we would definitely recommend Kerrisdale holdings and would stay there again if visiting Barcelona.  The stairs can feel a bit  tough at the end of the day -  but we didn't mind the exercise. ",

Overall, it was like spending a weekend at a friend's place.  The neighborhood was quite busy with people and shops until late into the night, but the room was quiet, clean and comfortable.  I slept like a baby.  I would only suggest that you confirm your check in and check out times with them in advance so as to avoid any confusion.

I have a cat allergy but she was so friendly and hospitable that I even managed to give her a few good pats. Teodora's place is very clean, so my allergic reaction was minimal. \r\n\r\nThe location is great. It's less than a 10 min walk to the Metro and very easy to find street parking. We enjoyed the garden space very much. We sat out there one late afternoon and felt as though we were truly Montreal residents!\r\n\r\nOne suggestion I make (which is NOT a deal breaker) is perhaps a small fan in the guest room. The windows are not very big, and we kept the door closed, to keep Tsitsou out, and it got stuffy pretty quickly. \r\n\r\nI will be giving Teodora a 10/10 and we hope to come back to visit soon!",

We cooked a lot and she was very respectful of giving us space that we were seeking.  Overall the price was awesome the area was great Sabrina was very cool and so is her decor in her home!

Rooms in the house were on separate ends making for more privacy. \nMy flight had been delayed multiple times, Vick was nice enough to allow my guest to check in without me. He and his sister, Maria were very fast in responding to our needs and even checking on us to make sure we were okay. \nDue to late flight departure, both Vick and Maria allowed later check out times to accommodate us. I would recommend this spot for small groups and I would love to stay here again! \nThanks so much! Trip successful! ",

On arrival I was met at the elevator with a big smile and the key. My surprise when I walked in the door was immense! The apartment is beautifully appointed, fresh spotless linen, a bowl of fruit, chocolates, and even an array of teabags and biscuits to have with my coffee. Such a lovely surprise. It's a spacious apartment with two beautiful bathrooms and amazing views. Even a large balcony with deck chairs. This apartment truly had everything we needed. There was a chemist near the ground floor doors, and a convenience store as well; coffee shops and cafes are nearby, and an excellent DFO shopping centre nearby (within walking distance; 1.3km I think).  I recommend this apartment to you without hesitation. Thanks Nicole! We'll be back!",

There is a very nice feeling of privacy provided by a privacy wall and a line of small palm trees that separates the property from the property next-door. There is a full kitchen, a beautiful bathroom, separate bedroom, and living room with flatscreen television and pull out couch.    They provided boogie boards, a cooler, two beach chairs, a Sunbrella,. Everything was clean, even the barbecue.   I would certainly stay there again if I had the opportunity to return. ",

He sent us a detailed \"Welcome Packet\" which included very useful tips for our Maui adventure. The condo was 100% clean and included everything one may need to prepare meals and have an enjoyable and relaxing stay. Prior to our arrival, he actually replaced most all the kitchen items such as silverware, dishes, cooking utensils, pots and pans, etc. The furnishings (including the beds) were extremely comfortable and the panoramic view, condo grounds and beach were SPECTACULAR!!! It was especially nice having a casual open-air restaurant on the property.

She was quite nice and offered us helpful advise on parking and local restaurants.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself looks exactly like the pictures and it is big enough for a couple and a kid. It is modern and nicely decorated. The kitchen is basically equipped, don't expect to cook there but you have everything for breakfast (do buy/bring tea and coffee). The \r\nbedroom is comfortable. Though it doesn't overlook Muzinho da Silveira street, which is quite a busy, you can still hear some noise at night and in the morning evening but nothing too bothering.\r\n\r\nWe though it was a good price for money, especially as we booked it shortly before our arrival.",
